# Reactle

## Imagine if Wordle Hated You

Reactle is a Wordle clone built to be very difficult and give players *strong* negative feedback.

This project is built using React, using the skills I learnt in the Scrimba React course.

The words are from the Scrabble dictionary, which I got from here: https://github.com/dolph/dictionary and used a python script to extract only the 5 letter words.
