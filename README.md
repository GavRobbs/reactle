# Reactle

This is a Wordle clone I built in React. It plays just like Wordle, but maybe is not as pretty.

I did this project to consolidate my skills after finishing the first React course on Scrimba.

The words are from the Scrabble dictionary, which I got from here: https://github.com/dolph/dictionary and used a python script to extract only the 5 letter words.
